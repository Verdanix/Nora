## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in our project, please report it to me privately. Here's how:

1. Email me at [security+nora@masonroot.dev](mailto:security+nora@masonroot.dev)
2. Include as much detail as possible about the vulnerability
3. I'll respond within **5 days** to acknowledge receipt of your report

## What Not to Do

Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until I've had a chance to address it. Also, avoid exploiting the vulnerability yourself or causing harm to others.

## Our Response Process

Once I receive your report, I'll:

1. Acknowledge receipt within **5 business days**
2. Investigate the reported vulnerability
3. Develop and release a patch or update
4. Publicly disclose the vulnerability once fixed

## Disclosure Timeline

I aim to resolve critical issues within **7 business days** of receiving a complete report. Less severe issues may take longer to address.

## Post-Disclosure Policy

After I've addressed the vulnerability and disclosed it publicly, I encourage responsible disclosure of the vulnerability details to allow users to protect themselves.

## Safe Harbor

I won't pursue legal action against researchers who:

1. Act in good faith
2. Avoid unauthorized data access or modification
3. Don't disrupt our service
4. Follow this policy

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English.

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
